Fixed the terrain averaging. Previously the terrain was averaged to the point where the height was the same 
( no variation in terrain).

January 22
Fixed bug where the "charachter" would not follow the height of the terrain

January 23
Added random movement to charachter, but it moves off the map sometimes.
